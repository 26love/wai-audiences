This page provides a starting point for information that is particularly relevant to trainers and educators.

## Understand the Foundation

Even if you know a lot about accessibility, we encourage you to read **[Introduction to Web Accessibility]({{ "/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/" | relative_url }})**. It includes links to videos and to lots more information that you might want to read now or later.

## Teach Accessibility

For outlines, slides, demos, and videos to help your students understand more about web accessibility, see **[Developing Web Accessibility Presentations and Training]({{ "/teach-advocate/accessibility-training/" | relative_url }})**.

## Make it Accessible

For guidance on making your training accessible to all of your potential audience, see **[How to Make Your Presentations Accessible to All
]({{ "/teach-advocate/accessible-presentations/" | relative_url }})**.

## More

We encourage you to look around the W3C WAI website to find other information that you might be interested in.
