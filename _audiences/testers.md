This page provides a starting point for information that is particularly relevant to testers and evaluators.

## Get a Foundation

Even if you know a lot about accessibility, we encourage you to read **[Introduction to Web Accessibility]({{ "/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/" | relative_url }})**. It includes links to videos and to lots more information that you might want to read now or later.

## Get Guidance

For information on testing/evaluating, see **[Evaluating Web Accessibility Overview]({{ "/test-evaluate/" | relative_url }})**. It links to information on evaluation tools, manual checks, and conformance evaluation resources.

## More

We encourage you to look around the W3C WAI website to find other information that you might be interested in.
