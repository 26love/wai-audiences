This page provides a starting point for information that is particularly relevant to visual designers and user interface designers.

## Get a Foundation

Even if you know a lot about accessibility, we encourage you to at least skim **[Introduction to Web Accessibility]({{ "/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/" | relative_url }})**. It includes links to videos and to lots more information that you might want to read now or later.

## Get Started

For brief descriptions of things to address for user interface design and visual design, see **[Tips for Getting Started Designing for Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/tips/designing)**.

## Get Comprehensive Guidance

To understand the standards and supporting materials for content, see **[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview]( http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php)**.

For a list of the WCAG success criteria that apply to certain areas, see:
