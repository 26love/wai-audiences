## Get Started

For brief descriptions of things to address for markup and coding, see **[Tips for Getting Started Developing for Web Accessibility]({{ "/tips/developing/" | relative_url }})**.

## Get Comprehensive Guidance

To understand the standards and supporting materials for content, see **[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview]({{ "/standards-guidelines/wcag/" | relative_url }})**.

For a list of the WCAG success criteria that apply to developing, see: **[How to Meet WCAG 2 (Quick Reference) â€“ filtered for "Developing" Tags](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG20/quickref/?currentsidebar=%23col_customize&tags=captcha%2Ccontrols%2Cerrors%2Cevents%2Cfocus%2Cforms%2Cheadings%2Ciframes%2Cimages%2Ckeyboard%2Clabels%2Clanguage%2Clinks%2Cmarkup%2Cmenus%2Cpage-title%2Cstructure%2Ctables%2Ctext%2Ctext-alternatives%2Cvideo)**.
